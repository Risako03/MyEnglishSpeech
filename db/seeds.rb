  Before we launch the event let us take a moment to thank the party organising committee, the team who set up the party and all those who are helping tonight. This party has been many months in the planning phase and many weeks in preparation. The team also raised a lot of money to help towards costs. We all owe you a lot.
  Now, one way we can show our appreciation is to have the time of our lives!
  There is great music, dancing, entertainers, food, drinks, snack kiosks, lots of things to see and do all round the venue and of course there is our Class to be with â€“ what more can you need.
  I have to tell you for safety the exits are signposted in case of emergency, if you need help contact one of the helpers right away and also for comfort the rest rooms are also signposted. Be sure to check out where everything is.
  Congratulations to all of us on our graduation. Tonight is our moment to celebrate wildly and to enjoy the company of our Class.

s3 = Speech.new(transcript: 'It is possible to imagine that human nature, the human intellect, emotions and feelings are completely independent of our technologies; that we are essentially ahistorical beings with one constant human nature that has remained the same throughout history or even pre-history? Sometimes evolutionary psychologistsâ€”those who belief human nature was fixed on the Pleistocene Savannahâ€”talk this way. I think this is demonstrably wrong.
  Consider ancient technologies, for example: cooking. When ancient hunter-gatherers discovered that firing their meat would not only make it tastier but could make their food easier to digest, it had a number of knock-on effects. It made parts of an animal carcass that were previously inedible edible, and also made it possible to preserve food longer. But this was not only a culinary but a cognitive success.Why? Because the amount of time our ancestors had to spend finding, hunting, and butchering their food, and thus maintain life, could be reduced making time available to invest in other activities such as thinking. Thanks to cooking, new time became available to prehistoric humans to plan, to consider, and invent other even more liberating technologiesâ€”or even to fritter away drawing bison and mammoth on the walls of caves.
